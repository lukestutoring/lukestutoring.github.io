    <h2> About </h2>
    <p> A little about me. I am a current Student at Allan Hancock Community
    College
    who is in the process of transfering to a University. I am applying to
    places like UC San Diego, UC Irvine, and many other universities. I am
    a computer science major and coding is my passion. I love it so much I
    created this entire website from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
    My academics have always been phenomenal. In High School I maintained a
    4.2+ GPA and committed to 5 AP courses. My highschool was Orcutt Academy
    so I am best at knowing local students from there, but I also have much
    tutoring experience from all around the state. My current community
    college GPA is 3.93 and is only planning on going up!
    </p>
    <p> For Tutoring experience I have 2+ years of tutoring for the Math
    and Science center at Allan Hancock. Also throughout my life I have
    been a peer mentor for many people. I have been a mentor for my previous
    Boy Scout troup for younger people. I am great at tutoring all age ranges
    and virtually any skill range. I am known to take my time and check in
    with students to make sure they understand concepts, and I am never
    frustrated or in a rush to help them understand. Tutoring and teaching
    has always been something I love.

    <h2> Services </h2>
    <p> My hourly rate is 20$ per hour, per student </p>
    <p> For group sessions I can lower the price per student according to
    how many students would like to join </p>
    <p>Note: Students should be somewhat similar in academic performance
    to have an effective group tutoring session.
