            I was in the Robotics team for Orcutt Academy for four years, becoming a lead for 2 and a half of them. I lead the software branch during which our robot made it to compete in the world championship in Texas.

            My life experience comes throughout schooling and any activity, in which II have consitently been a leader and a guide. I work very well with children, being able to connect with them, and also talk with them in terms to make a meaningful understanding of the topics I tutor them in.
            </p>
            <p> Personality wise, I am a very adaptable person. I am able to connect with almost anyone I meet. I am also a very determined person with a lot of patience. Being in computer science means grinding away at a error for days at a time, and I will put just as much effort into the student as I would then. Willing to go back, remind, and help people through their coursework, while also remaining on an effective pace to reach their learning goals.
